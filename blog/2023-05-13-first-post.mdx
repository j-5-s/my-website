This blog is going to be a rambling of my thoughts in my journey
to learn new software.  

The first problem that comes to mind with a blog is content theft.
If I write original content I want to make sure
unoriginal individuals don't come along and
steal it. Cause I know they will, it would be great to have a way
to prove I am the original author. NFT's seem like a good use case
for this problem. 

The solution:
After I publish a page I will mint an NFT that will contain:
 - the url of the content
 - the html content of the page in text
 - a screenshot of the page
The page will contain a metatag such as:
```html
<meta name="ethereum-address" content="0x1234567890abcdef">
```
This will be done by a chrome plugin that when activated will look for the meta tag and
 - sign a transaction as that wallet owner
 - create the data (above) and send it to Arweave
 - create the NFT on network (polygon?)
