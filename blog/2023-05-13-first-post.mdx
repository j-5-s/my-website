title: NFT's to combat content theft

This blog is going to be a rambling of my thoughts in my journey
to learn new software.  

The first problem to solve in creating content is theft.
If I work hard writing original content I want to make sure
lazy and unoriginal individuals don't just come along and
steal it. With this in mind, NFT's seem like a good possible
solution to this problem. 

The solution:
After I publish a page I will mint an NFT that will contain:
 - the url
 - the html content of the page
 - a screenshot
The page will contain a metatag such as:
```html
<meta name="ethereum-address" content="0x1234567890abcdef">
```
This will be done by a chrome plugin that when on the page will look for the meta tag and
 - sign a transaction as that wallet owner
 - create the data (above) and send it to Arweave
 - create the NFT on polygon network
