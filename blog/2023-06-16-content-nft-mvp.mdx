About a month ago I started this blog and [exploring the idea of
utilizing NFT's to prove ownership of content](https://www.j5s.dev/blog/nft-copyright-extension).

The result is an [nx monorepo](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft) that
contains a [chrome extension](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft/tree/main/apps/extension),
a [nextjs app](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft/tree/main/apps/nft-j5s-dev), and a 
[solidity contract](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft/blob/main/libs/contracts/contracts/BookmarkNFT.sol).

This project was a learning experience for me and not something I intend
to publish to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). 

It's been a fun experience learning some new things and brushing up on sold old. I've clearly 
increased my public [github profile](https://github.com/j-5-s) over that time and hope to continue doing so on new projects.

The web3 app is hosted at [https://nft.j5s.dev](https://nft.j5s.dev).
