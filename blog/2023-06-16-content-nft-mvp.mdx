About a month ago I started this blog and [exploring the idea of
utilizing NFT's to prove ownership of content](https://www.j5s.dev/blog/nft-copyright-extension).

The result is an [nx monorepo](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft) that
contains a [chrome extension](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft/tree/main/apps/extension),
a [nextjs app](https://github.com/j-5-s/bookmark-nft/tree/main/apps/nft-j5s-dev), and a solidity contract.

This project was a learning experience for me and not something I intend
to publish to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
