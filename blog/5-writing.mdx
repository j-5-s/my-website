The mental model of content today means you publish when you are done.
It means you must be perfect, you must be an someone of authority,
or at least self aware and disclose that you are not.  Unintended errors,
incomplete works are look at negatively and discouraged. What if this was
different?  What if we published on save?  What if we become self aware, 
vulnerable to the world and accept feedback for when we are wrong or incomplete.


What if we were never "done" with a blog post or a book.  What if we versioned
it and maintained content like we do software.  Code is Poetry after all, right?

We would have insights into the author, a closer relationship with their mind.
As opposed today, a world of violent words at war with polarizing viewpoints.

The new york times ("the authority") writes a "hit" piece on Bitcoin.  Pick your
team as you read and hate or love the article.  Our mental model is passive aggressive.

What if when we saw mistakes in facts we read, we submitted changes like we do PR's?
What if as authors we were ok with being wrong?  What if we thought of ourselves like
editors to our "own content" and writers that that of which we read?  It
would be a much better world to learn in.  But no, today we pay hundreds of thousands
of dollars to go to college and be trained by the smartest, most educated among us
who have authority over us.
