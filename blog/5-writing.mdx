The mental model of content today means you publish when you are done.
It means you must be perfect, you must be an someone of authority,
or at least self aware and disclose that you are not.  Unintended errors,
incomplete works are looked at negatively and discouraged. What if this was
different?  What if we published on save?  What if we become self aware, 
vulnerable to the world and accepted feedback for when we are wrong or incomplete.

What if we were never "done" with a blog post or a book.  What if we versioned
it and maintained it like we do software.  Code is Poetry after all, right?

We would have more insights into the author, a closer relationship with their mind.
As opposed today, a world of violent words at war with polarizing viewpoints.

The New York Times ("the authority") [wrote a "hit" piece on Bitcoin](https://standardcrypto.wordpress.com/2023/04/10/another-lame-new-york-times-hit-piece-on-bitcoin/). 
Pick your team as you read and hate or love the article.  This mental model is passive aggressive.

What if when we saw mistakes in facts we read, we submitted changes like we do PR's?
What if as authors we were ok with being wrong (unintentionally)? 
What if we thought of ourselves like editors to our "own content" and
writers that that of which we read?  It
would be a much better world to learn in for sure.  But no, today we pay hundreds of thousands
of dollars to go to college and be trained by the smartest, most educated among us
who have authority over us so that one day we can be educated and 
experts in a field too.  Only then, at the end of the road, are we complete...until were not.
Even Einstein was wrong at times.

What if we were not judged on the outcome of a single piece of work or game?
What if we were judged on how far we have changed? What if we tracked it and
the change was just as important as the content itself.

The mental model today is wrong.  I'm far from perfect. Why must I be perfect when I speak, write, or publish.
Why am i offended when others correct me.  It comes across as rude and I may get offended.

What if we never stopped thinking of ourselves as students and our minds were malleable
to thoughts of others, their views, and their words.

You may think website is not "professional".  The homepage is the content from [https://docusaurus.io/](https://docusaurus.io/)
after installing it. I have not gotten around to making it my own...yet.  
Why wait to publish? Why not allow others to contribute?

The new mental model is distributed, selfless, vulnerable, and open to change. 
It can still be negative, but the negativity is aimed at those of us who claim authority,
who are not open to correction, who publish finished and "perfect" works. Not many
articles, books, or words stand the test of time.  Why must we claim to be right, like its a 
truth that spans eternity.  It is clear our views change over long periods of time, 
but in the short term we are absolute? It doesn't add up.
