The mental model of content today means you publish when you are done.
It means you must be perfect, you must be an someone of authority,
or at least self aware and disclose that you are not.  Unintended errors,
incomplete works are look at negatively and discouraged. What if this was
different?  What if we published on save?  What if we become self aware, 
vulnerable to the world and accept feedback for when we are wrong or incomplete.
