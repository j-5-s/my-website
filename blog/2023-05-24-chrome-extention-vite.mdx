## Chrome Extension Update
In my [previous post](/blog/chrome-extension-customizations) I added a few customizations to a great
boilerplate library for creating a chrome extension with React. 
However, after running into webpack errors (such as [this one](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react/issues/150)) with websockets and HMR
I've decided to leverage a new boilerplate - [chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite).
Its got all the features of the previous one except runs on Vite for local development.

I've created [a template](https://github.com/j-5-s/chrome-ext-vite) for myself for future extensions with the additional `usePersistedState`
hook as previously described.
