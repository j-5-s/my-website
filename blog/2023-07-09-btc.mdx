I've come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is the only fair monetary policy. Unlike the
federal reserve (a private institution created in 1913 that took the power of money from the congress and to the bankers), bitcoin is not and can not be controlled by a centralized authority.  Its rules are based on math and has grown passed a network effect that makes it the winning blockchain and long term (as in thousand of years) currency standard.  

 Bitcoiners know this but one day it will become mainstream for people to save for themselves and for their children in btc as an alternative to real estate, stocks, gold, art or any other asset that can be used to store value. The price of those other assets will gradually decline towards their marginal cost of production (Jeff Booth), which in some cases is zero (fiat).

Your purchasing decision to eat out or spend excessive bitcoin will compete with the idea of saving that money. However, It’s not just the value of the money for eating out which you must consider. The $100 you decided to save by not going to a restaurant is worth $1000 in 30 years at least! That’s a 10x gain from doing nothing. Additionally its not $1000 of tomorrows money (from an inflationary point of view), it's $1,000 of todays money (because btc is deflationary). In other words in 30 years, you could eat at the same restaurant ten times over vs one time today. A low time preference will be the wealthiest mentality you one could live by. 

The impact will be phenomenal. Companies with waste will get squeezed. Companies will focus on a products longevity as its primary feature. Aging machines that work for hundreds of years will become standard. Every year you honor your old machines and purchases more and more. It becomes art and something you are proud of. By the time one is 60 years old and need to retire they will be rich just by having chosen a low time preference. 

Your goal should be to pass your stack down to your children. They have the responsibility to hold for the next generation. They should add to their families wealth, not take from it. 

I know this because I know that bitcoin is energy and energy is the law of nature and nature does not die, it evolves for the better. The shitcoin market in crypto is not uncommon. We see it today in third world currencies that hyperinflate, we see stocks with companies that manipulate their share price through buybacks borrowed on artificially low interest rates.  What we also see is the bitcoin cycle destroying those shitcoins by design.  Bear markets expose and cleanup the fraud (SBF, Do Kwon and all the others) while bull markets grow the user base.  

But as bitcoin grows its network effect is exponential and the shitcoins and corrupt nation states will die on their own.  Mother Nature at its finest.

Lastly, I believe we are on the verge of "suddenly" in the "gradually then suddenly" context. Black Rock and all the banks are creating bitcoin ETF. Every bank will have to compete to buy btc. Game theory would lead to believe all banks have to buy and the only way to lose is to not buy. First with the banks, then with the nation states. Nearly 15 years in, only a few "lucky" people had a chance to front run the new world.
